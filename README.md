# 📊 Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

Welcome to my **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project**! 🚀  
This project showcases a complete data warehousing and analytics solution — from raw data ingestion to building insightful business reports. It is built using **SQL Server** and follows industry best practices in **ETL, data modeling**, and **data analysis**.

---

## 🏗️ Data Architecture – Medallion Layers

The project implements the **Medallion Architecture**, separating the data into three layers for better management and scalability:

- **🔹 Bronze Layer**  
  Raw data ingestion from CSV files (ERP and CRM) into SQL Server without transformation.

- **🔸 Silver Layer**  
  Cleansed and standardized data prepared for modeling.

- **⭐ Gold Layer**  
  Business-ready data modeled into a **star schema** for reporting and analytics.
